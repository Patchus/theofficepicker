# The Office (NBC) Picker
This works only for netflix, but you can easily change the code to not use the URL

This is used soley for the use of picking and opening a Office Episode, nothing more.

If you are like me, and only like seasons where Micheal Scott was there, you can exclude seasons.
```python randomoffice.py [8,9]```

This does not totally work, every once in a while I get a varisty blues episode. I'll work on fixing that.
